## First task

This program is used to generate positions for chess variants perft tests
It takes the starting position of a variant and uses scalachess to play randomly some specific number of moves. It will repeat the process to generate a list of positions.

Input is a variant, a number of moves to play, a number of generated positions

## Second task

Use the those generated positions to generate perft test case

## Notes

- the first step can be done quickly so it can be run locally
- the second step should use github workflows to avoid wasting time
=> another repository
